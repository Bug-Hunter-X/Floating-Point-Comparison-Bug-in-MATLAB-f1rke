This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in MATLAB related to floating-point number comparisons.  Floating-point numbers are inherently imprecise, and direct equality comparisons can lead to unexpected results. The `bug.m` file contains a function that showcases this problem.  The `bugSolution.m` file offers a solution demonstrating a more robust approach to comparing floating-point numbers using a tolerance value. The issue is described in more detail in the bug description section.
